                One of my favourite hobby is traveling to 
                various places.In the younger age, 
                traveling becomes a part of learning 
                whereas in the older age it becomes a 
                part of experience.

                Traveling to the temples, monasteries,
                fortifications, ramparts, libraries and 
                castles is a good utilization of time. 
                Some people believe that watching movies 
                of the important places in the world 
                passes the similar pleasure that is 
                involved in traveling. But they 
                deliberately overlook that the feel 
                of actuality offers a special type of 
                stir and pleasure.
